\title{Calculate probability of PacBio reads having WW, CC or WC state.}
\usage{
countProbOld(minusCounts, plusCounts, alpha = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{minusCounts}{Minus (Watson) read counts aligned to PacBio reads.}

\item{plusCounts}{Plus (Crick) read counts aligned to PacBio reads.}

\item{alpha}{Estimated level of background Strand-seq reads.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} of binomial probabilities for a given counts of plus and minus reads
}
\description{
Import counts of directional Strand-seq reads aligned to PacBio reads and calculates binomial probabilites of PacBio reads being WW, CC or WC state.
