              single-cell tri-channel processing (scTRIP), a computational
              framework that integrates read depth, template strand and
              haplotype phase to comprehensively discover SVs in individual
              cells. We surveyed SV landscapes of 565 single cells, including
              transformed epithelial cells and patient-derived leukemic
              samples, to discover abundant SV classes, including inversions,

  abstract = "Motivation: Current sequencing technologies are able to produce
              reads orders of magnitude longer than ever possible before. Such
              long reads have sparked a new interest in de novo genome
              assembly, which removes reference biases inherent to
              re-sequencing approaches and allows for a direct characterization
              of complex genomic variants. However, even with latest
              algorithmic advances, assembling a mammalian genome from long
              error-prone reads incurs a significant computational burden and
              does not preclude occasional misassemblies. Both problems could
              potentially be mitigated if assembly could commence for each
              chromosome separately. Results: To address this, we show how
              single-cell template strand sequencing (Strand-seq) data can be
              leveraged for this purpose. We introduce a novel latent variable
              model and a corresponding Expectation Maximization algorithm,
              termed SaaRclust, and demonstrates its ability to reliably
              cluster long reads by chromosome. For each long read, this
              approach produces a posterior probability distribution over all
              chromosomes of origin and read directionalities. In this way, it
              allows to assess the amount of uncertainty inherent to sparse
              Strand-seq data on the level of individual reads. Among the reads
              that our algorithm confidently assigns to a chromosome, we
              observed more than 99\% correct assignments on a subset of
              Pacific Bioscience reads with 30.1x coverage. To our
              knowledge, SaaRclust is the first approach for the in silico
              separation of long reads by chromosome prior to assembly.

  abstract = "Summary: Massively parallel sequencing is now widely used, but
              data interpretation is only as good as the reference assembly to
              which it is aligned. While the number of reference assemblies has
              rapidly expanded, most of these remain at intermediate stages of
              completion, either as scaffold builds, or as chromosome builds
              (consisting of correctly ordered, but not necessarily correctly
              oriented scaffolds separated by gaps). Completion of de novo
              assemblies remains difficult, as regions that are repetitive or
              hard to sequence prevent the accumulation of larger scaffolds,
              and create errors such as misorientations and mislocalizations.
              Thus, complementary methods for determining the orientation and
              positioning of fragments are important for finishing assemblies.
              Strand-seq is a method for determining template strand
              inheritance in single cells, information that can be used to

              template strands used during DNA replication. This protocol,

              of DNA, in which each single strand of a DNA molecule is
              distinguished based on its 5'-3' orientation. Culturing cells in
              a thymidine analog for one round of cell division labels nascent

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Chromosome instability leads to aneuploidy, a state
              in which cells have abnormal numbers of chromosomes, and is found
              in two out of three cancers. In a chromosomal instable p53
              deficient mouse model with accelerated lymphomagenesis, we
              previously observed whole chromosome copy number changes
              affecting all lymphoma cells. This suggests that chromosome
              instability is somehow suppressed in the aneuploid lymphomas or
              that selection for frequently lost/gained chromosomes
              out-competes the CIN-imposed mis-segregation. RESULTS: To
              distinguish between these explanations and to examine karyotype
              dynamics in chromosome instable lymphoma, we use a newly
              developed single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) platform
              that provides a complete and unbiased overview of copy number
              variations (CNV) in individual cells. To analyse these scWGS
              data, we develop AneuFinder, which allows annotation of copy
              number changes in a fully automated fashion and quantification of
              CNV heterogeneity between cells. Single-cell sequencing and
              AneuFinder analysis reveals high levels of copy number
              heterogeneity in chromosome instability-driven murine T-cell
              lymphoma samples, indicating ongoing chromosome instability.
              Application of this technology to human B cell leukaemias reveals
              different levels of karyotype heterogeneity in these cancers.
              CONCLUSION: Our data show that even though aneuploid tumours
              select for particular and recurring chromosome combinations,
              single-cell analysis using AneuFinder reveals copy number
              heterogeneity. This suggests ongoing chromosome instability that
              other platforms fail to detect. As chromosome instability might
              drive tumour evolution, karyotype analysis using single-cell
              sequencing technology could become an essential tool for cancer
              treatment stratification.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative
              disease of the brain and the most common form of dementia in the
              elderly. Aneuploidy, a state in which cells have an abnormal
              number of chromosomes, has been proposed to play a role in
              neurodegeneration in AD patients. Several studies using
              fluorescence in situ hybridization have shown that the brains of
              AD patients contain an increased number of aneuploid cells.
              However, because the reported rate of aneuploidy in neurons
              ranges widely, a more sensitive method is needed to establish a
              possible role of aneuploidy in AD pathology. RESULTS: In the
              current study, we used a novel single-cell whole genome
              sequencing (scWGS) approach to assess aneuploidy in isolated
              neurons from the frontal cortex of normal control individuals (n
              = 6) and patients with AD (n = 10). The sensitivity and
              specificity of our method was shown by the presence of three
              copies of chromosome 21 in all analyzed neuronal nuclei of a
              Down's syndrome sample (n = 36). Very low levels of aneuploidy
              were found in the brains from control individuals (n = 589) and
              AD patients (n = 893). In contrast to other studies, we observe
              no selective gain of chromosomes 17 or 21 in neurons of AD
              patients. CONCLUSION: scWGS showed no evidence for common
              aneuploidy in normal and AD neurons. Therefore, our results do
              not support an important role for aneuploidy in neuronal cells in
              the pathogenesis of AD. This will need to be confirmed by future
              studies in larger cohorts.",

  abstract = "Identifying genomic features that differ between individuals and
              cells can help uncover the functional variants that drive
              phenotypes and disease susceptibilities. For this, single-cell
              studies are paramount, as it becomes increasingly clear that the
              contribution of rare but functional cellular subpopulations is
              important for disease prognosis, management, and progression.
              Until now, studying these associations has been challenged by our
              inability to map structural rearrangements accurately and
              comprehensively. To overcome this, we coupled single-cell
              sequencing of DNA template strands (Strand-seq) with custom
              analysis software to rapidly discover, map, and genotype genomic
              rearrangements at high resolution. This allowed us to explore the
              distribution and frequency of inversions in a heterogeneous cell
              population, identify several polymorphic domains in complex
              regions of the genome, and locate rare alleles in the reference
              assembly. We then mapped the entire genomic complement of
              inversions within two unrelated individuals to characterize their
              distinct inversion profiles and built a nonredundant global
              reference of structural rearrangements in the human genome. The

              genome of an individual, yet methods to directly chart the unique

              introduce single-cell DNA template strand sequencing (Strand-seq)
              as a novel approach to phasing diploid genomes along the entire
              length of all chromosomes. We demonstrate this by building a
              complete haplotype for a HapMap individual (NA12878) at high
              accuracy (concordance 99.3\%), without using generational
              information or statistical inference. By use of this approach, we
              mapped all meiotic recombination events in a family trio with
              high resolution (median range 14 kb) and phased larger
              structural variants like deletions, indels, and balanced
              rearrangements like inversions. Lastly, the single-cell
              resolution of Strand-seq allowed us to observe loss of
              heterozygosity regions in a small number of cells, a significant
              advantage for studies of heterogeneous cell populations, such as
              cancer cells. We conclude that Strand-seq is a unique and
              powerful approach to completely phase individual genomes and map

              unphased variants with respect to a reference genome. This lack
